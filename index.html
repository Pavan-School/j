            <p>Hello, my name is Jasmita and my dream was to become a doctor as a child, but as I grew, I started to understand the struggles needed to reach that goal, and it was too long, and I started to not really like biology, so I gave up that dream job and decided to become an IT Software Engineer or a Programmer. This is because when I joined high school, I did not really like computer science, but I still decided to join a computer class, and then I found my passion for coding and programs. So, my dream job is to become an IT Software Engineer or a Programmer.</p>
        </main>
        <p>An overview of the content of my portfolio:</p>
        
        <h2>Unit 2</h2>
        <p>In Unit 2, I learnt how to write basic commands in HTML and I also learnt that all most all websites are made with HTML. This really helped me understand how hard it is to make a simple website, firstly I had to remeber all the codes and learn when to and how to use them. The most difficult ones to use and understand are below in order:</p>
    	<ol>
		<li> "div" function </li>
		<li> Embedding a video </li>
		<li> Embedding a poster </li>
		<li> Learning how to indent the code properly </li>
	</ol>
	<p>Even though it was quite hard to learn all of this by myself without, help I made it through. These lessons didn't really teach the basics but instead went straight to the hard code. After understanding the basics it was pretty easy to make my own website but the embedded video part was not very easy because I didn't have any mp4 or webm files hence I had to comprimise.</p>

	<p>In this lesson, I also learnt:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Heading</li>
		<li> Sub-heading</li>
		<li> Paragraphs </li>
		<li> Ordered lists </li>
		<li> Unordered lists </li>
	</ul>

        
        <h2>Unit 3</h2>
        <p>In Unit 3, I learnt how to use id and class to manipulate only specific elements of the code. I learnt how to create a table and how to make use of the tables in order to make my website more appealing. The following items are what I found most difficult yet interesting:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Box model</li>
                <li>Typography</li>
                <li>Navigation menu</li>
                <li>Padding</li>
            </ol> 
        <p>The element I found most difficult to understand was padding because first of all I didn't understand the use of it but after sometime of playing around with my code, I was able to fiqure it's function out which really helped me understand the entire concept!
        </p>
        
        <h2 >Unit 4</h2>
        <p>In Unit 4, I learnt how to create a background without making the image repeat if its too small, and I learnt how to create an image by merging different images together. I basically learnt how to : </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a photo album</li>
                <li>Create a button</li>
                <li>Create a web page banner</li>
                <li>Make a collage in microsoft paint</li>
            </ul> 
        <p>The element I found most difficult to learn was to make the website background because the tiled image wasn't showing up in the background but it took sometime to figure it out.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Unit 5</h2>
        <p>In Unit 5, I learnt how to write basic javascript code and adjust the code to make sure it doesn't interupt the entire process. Some of the basic javascript commands I learnt are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>if and else command</li>
                <li>defining a function</li>
                <li>creating a variable</li>
            </ul>
        <p>The element I found most difficult was making sure to place the variable before the code so it can read the variable and then understand what to do with the variable but I placed the code before the variable hence it didn't work.
        </p>
        	
        <h2>Unit 6</h2>
        <p>In unit 6, I learnt that a small error in the code can go unnoticed but can significantly chage a website on certain browsers. For example, I missed a few closing tags but my web browser didn't show it but when I opened it on another web browser, it doesn't work.</p>
